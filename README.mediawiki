=Server Side OSGi=
This project contains the minimum set of components needed to run OSGi in the application server like Tomcat. 
Follow the instructions to create a deployable war file.

==Install Maven==
...

==Clone==
git clone https://github.com/wimjongman/server-side-OSGi.git

==Build==
mvn clean install

==Deploy==
Find the '''server.war''' file in '''com.remainsoftware.server.product/target''' and deploy this file in your application server.

If you have kept the defaults then the webpage should be available here [http://localhost:8080/server/remain/software http://localhost:8080/server/remain/software]. 
If you did not keep the defaults then I assume you know your way.
